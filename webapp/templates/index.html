    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Turing Test Simulator. In this test, you will be presented with a series of images and captions, and your task is to determine whether each caption was generated by a human or by an artificial intelligence algorithm. The Turing Test, proposed by computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, is a classic benchmark for evaluating the ability of machines to mimic human behavior. By participating in this test, you'll be helping evaluate the state-of-the-art algorithms for image captioning and to see how well they can imitate human language. Your contributions will be invaluable in advancing the field of artificial intelligence! To get started, simply click the 'Begin Test' button below and follow the instructions.</h3>
